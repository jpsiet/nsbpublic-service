Basics
Once oracel 19c install verify by opening sqlplus
search  sqlplus/sqlsheell
username sys as sysdba
password as Username one

SID ( site identifier)  choose same as XE or create ocrl any thing is good

for sql developer

create connection

give db name
testdb
username sys
password same as  global data base one system
change role sysdba (in role dropdown)
in sid change oracl  ( as we have changed databse to oracle to orcl)

select sysdate from dual; // just to show today date
select * from all_users;  /// select from all tables by 



Create  table/schema for testing 
CREATE table  college ( id int,  name varchar(50) null,age INT NOT NULL,PRIMARY KEY(id,name));

primary key can be combination of two column
Column can be default  value
CREATE table  college ( id int,  name varchar(50) null,age INT  default 21,PRIMARY KEY(id));
INSERT INTO college(id,name)  values(2,'jitendra');




Creating new user for app ( pluggable data base)

we need to set session container for plugable database

alter session set container=orclpdb;
DROP USER nsbpublic CASCADE;   // in case already created 
CREATE USER nsbpublic IDENTIFIED BY nsbpublic;
GRANT CONNECT to nsbpublic;
GRANT CREATE SESSION, GRANT any PRIVILEGE to nsbpublic;
GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO nsbpublic;
GRANT CREATE TABLE to nsbpublic;
grant all privileges to nsbpublic;


check if user created or not 
select * from all_uesers;  should display nsbpblic 

Once this user created without any issue
create new connection

give user name and password and  instead  of going with sid go with service
give value orclpdb for oracle 19c

we can check plugable data base name 
select name, pdb from v$services order by pdb, name;
show con_name;
select name,open_mode  from v$pdbs;

Once connection successs , connect with backend
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521/orclpdb   # with service name
like here in case username nsbpublic password nsbpublic
in case with id ( but here will not work with ID)
#spring.datasource.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:orcl # with SID 

pluugable data base name  orclpdb

Now time to connect to create shcema/user in order to work/test with project

Issue
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

 DROP TABLE ecommerceapp.product_category1
 CASCADE CONSTRAINTS 
  PURGE ;



# in html format   // display data in specific format and export 
spool C:\jitendra\document\mydata.html
select /*html*/* from all_users; 
select * from all_tables where owner='SYS';


How to change data format

go  to tool =>preference == databse ==> NLS

then change form DD-MMM ( means month name like 01 jan) so if you want to ( 01-01) then do DD-MM




ORA-01109: database not open

Login with sys user.
alter the session to the pluggable database with the following command.
SQL>alter session set container=orclpdb;
Next startup the database.
sql> startup
SQL>startup After that database will not show the above error.
